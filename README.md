# Grid-Synchronization-of-3-Phase-VSI

As of 31st December 2020, the national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 375.32 GW.
Of this total installed capacity, Renewable energy sources account for about 33%. With increasing
penetration of Renewable energy sources in the current grid, the need of establishing an efficient
control on the distributed power generating systems (DGs) becomes even higher.
When synchronizing the renewable resources into grid will faces various power quality problem like
sag, swell, unbalance current, voltage flicker etc., instability of grid, frequency deviation. So, to
overcome these problems, grid synchronization with controlling techniques is implemented.
Therefore, grid synchronization techniques play a major part in keeping the grid stability.
The purpose of Grid Synchronization is to monitor, access, enable, and automatically take the control
action to prevent the abnormalities of voltage and frequency by the minimization of difference in
voltage, frequency and phase angle between the corresponding phases of the generator output
and grid supply. The values of grid voltage frequency, amplitude and phase are necessary for
carrying out grid synchronization.
Our project deals with the study of various grid synchronization techniques which can be used.
Starting off with the conventional SRF-PLL method for grid synchronization, the study also includes
other techniques based on ANF filter and DSOGI-PLL.
